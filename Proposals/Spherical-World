# Project Activity: Spherical Surface Investigation in Unreal Engine

## Overview
This project is a focused activity within the **Unreal Engine meta-project** under the **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP)** initiative. The goal is to explore and develop a spherical virtual surface as a foundation for future immersive environments. This work aligns with the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework by integrating global-scale geography and physics into virtual space.

## Objectives
1. **Spherical Surface Modeling**:
   - Create a scalable sphere as the primary virtual environment surface.
   - Apply geographic projections (e.g., latitude and longitude) for positioning.

2. **Coordinate System Implementation**:
   - Investigate spherical coordinate systems to map objects accurately.
   - Align Unreal Engine's Cartesian system with the spherical geometry.

3. **Physics and Interaction**:
   - Enable gravity and physics to operate radially relative to the sphere.
   - Test object movement, placement, and interaction on the curved surface.

4. **Lighting and Shadows**:
   - Evaluate how light interacts with the spherical surface for realistic shadow casting.
   - Integrate dynamic lighting for global scenarios.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Ensure efficient rendering and interaction for large-scale environments.

## Deliverables
1. **Spherical Model**:
   - A scalable sphere in Unreal Engine with applied textures.
   - Integration of a functional coordinate system for object placement.
2. **Physics and Shadow Testing**:
   - A demonstration of gravity and physics interaction on the spherical surface.
   - Documentation of light-shadow behaviors.
3. **Documentation**:
   - Guidelines for spherical modeling and optimization.
   - Integration notes for future expansions.

## Relationship to Rodrigo Vega’s Scope of Work
Rodrigo’s internship can focus on establishing foundational components such as:
- Testing shadow casting on simpler flat and transparent surfaces before scaling up to spherical geometries.
- Developing early light and physics simulations that can be adapted for spherical modeling.
- Laying groundwork for integrating spherical environments into larger Unreal projects.

This activity provides a stepping stone for Rodrigo's contribution to align with broader research goals while keeping his tasks manageable within his skill development timeline.
