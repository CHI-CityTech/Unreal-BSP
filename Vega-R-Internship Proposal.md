# Internship Proposal: Core Infrastructure Development for Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS)

**Organizing Institution**: Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)  

**Meta-Project**: Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP)  

**Personnel**:  
- **Intern**: Rodrigo Vega  
- **Supervisor**: David Smith  

**Timeframe**: 120-132 hours over 10 weeks  

**Effort**:  
- Weekly effort logging and progress updates.  
- Collaborative development via GitHub and Unreal Engine integration.  
- Weekly meetings with supervisors for feedback and planning.  

**Activity Type**:  
- Research and development internship.  
- Tasks include creating a virtual environment, shadow mechanics testing, asset integration, and documenting processes for collaborative use.  

## Overview
This internship focuses on developing a foundational virtual environment for the **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP)** project within Unreal Engine. The intern, Rodrigo Vega, will create and refine a virtual environment that mirrors physical shadow puppetry dynamics. The project includes the development of responsive physics systems, shadow-casting mechanics, asset integration, and real-time documentation through GitHub and Unreal’s development environment.

## Objectives
1. **Establish a Functional Virtual Environment**:
   - Develop a 3D floor that responds to Unreal Engine's physics and gravity systems.
   - Create a projection screen allowing shadows to be seen on both sides, exploring semi-transparency as part of Unreal Engine capabilities.
2. **Implement Shadow Mechanics**:
   - Design and test light sources that generate realistic shadows.
   - Use basic objects (e.g., cubes) for initial shadow tests to replicate physical-world shadow-casting behaviors.
3. **Asset Integration**:
   - Import 2D and 3D assets into the Unreal environment.
   - Experiment with occlusion-based and alpha-masking methods for shadow creation.
4. **Collaboration and Documentation**:
   - Regularly log weekly progress, update GitHub, and link Unreal development code to the repository for accessibility and review.

## Deliverables
1. **Virtual Environment**:
   - A 3D space with a physics-enabled floor and projection screen.
   - Functional light source with realistic shadow-casting capabilities.
2. **Shadow-Casting Tests**:
   - Basic tests with simple objects to ensure shadow dynamics align with physical-world behaviors.
3. **Asset Import and Interaction**:
   - Imported assets rigged for basic movements and shadow projection.
4. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Documentation of workflows, code, and testing results.
   - Integration with Unreal Engine's development environment.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Creation (20-25 Hours)
- Activities:
  - Build a 3D floor with physics and gravity functionality.
  - Develop a projection screen with potential transparency for double-sided shadow viewing.
- Deliverables:
  - Completed environment prototype with floor and screen.

### Phase 2: Shadow Mechanics Testing (20-25 Hours)
- Activities:
  - Implement and position light sources.
  - Test shadow casting with basic objects like cubes and spheres.
- Deliverables:
  - Working light-shadow system with initial testing results.

### Phase 3: Asset Import and Shadow Interaction (25-30 Hours)
- Activities:
  - Import puppet and object assets in formats such as `.obj`.
  - Test occlusion-based and alpha-masking shadow mechanics.
- Deliverables:
  - Shadow-optimized assets integrated into the environment.

### Phase 4: Basic Movement Integration (20-25 Hours)
- Activities:
  - Enable basic movement of imported assets.
  - Test shadow dynamics during movement.
- Deliverables:
  - Functional prototype with movement and shadow integration.

### Phase 5: Documentation and Submission (20-25 Hours)
- Activities:
  - Document workflows, standards, and findings in the GitHub repository.
  - Integrate Unreal Engine code with GitHub for collaborative access.
- Deliverables:
  - Complete repository with README, code, and test documentation.

## Weekly Meetings and Progress Tracking
- Schedule weekly 30-minute meetings to review progress and address challenges.
- Maintain a weekly effort log, detailing hours and completed tasks.
- Regularly push updates to GitHub, ensuring version control and project transparency.

## Learning Outcomes
- Develop expertise in Unreal Engine’s physics, lighting, and asset integration capabilities.
- Explore real-time shadow dynamics and their application to virtual environments.
- Gain experience in collaborative documentation and cross-platform development workflows.
