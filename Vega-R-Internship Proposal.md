# Internship Proposal: Development of a Flat-Surface Virtual Environment for the Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS)

Intern: Rodrigo Vega  
Supervisor: David B. Smith  

Timeframe: Winter/Spring 2025.

## Overview
This internship focuses on research-driven development of a flat, bounded virtual environment within Unreal Engine for the **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP)** project. The goal is to establish a foundational platform for shadow puppetry dynamics while integrating principles of light-shadow interaction and physics. By prioritizing research, this internship ensures efficient use of existing resources and minimizes redundancy, enabling the intern to design and build effectively.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Research and Resource Review (25-30 Hours)

#### Objectives
- Investigate Unreal Engine’s capabilities for light-shadow mechanics, object occlusion, and translucent materials.
- Identify existing tools, plugins, or assets that support shadow-casting and fabric translucency features.
- Understand Unreal Engine’s handling of front/rear projection and responsiveness of materials to light and shadow.

#### Activities
1. **Light and Shadow Mechanics**:
   - Research how Unreal Engine handles real-time lighting and [shadow generation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/shadowing-in-unreal-engine).
   - Explore documentation and tutorials on dynamic and static light sources.
   - Investigate shadow quality settings and optimization techniques.

2. **Object Occlusion**:
   - Study how objects block light to cast shadows in Unreal Engine.
   - Test simple 3D objects (e.g., cubes, spheres) to verify occlusion dynamics.

3. **Translucent Materials**:
   - Research Unreal Engine’s capabilities for translucent materials to allow shadows on both sides of a surface.
   - Test transparency and translucency settings on planes to simulate fabric behavior.

4. **Comparison with Physical Testing**:
   - Review findings from the SeaScape 360 project on fabric and projection testing.
   - Identify testing protocols to evaluate translucency and shadow response in the virtual environment.

#### Deliverables
- Comprehensive research report summarizing Unreal Engine’s capabilities for light, shadow, and translucent surfaces.
- All research material links and sources uploaded to the Zotero account
- Recommendations for design and testing based on findings.

### Phase 2: Design and Testing Plan (20-25 Hours)

#### Objectives
- Develop a detailed design plan for the flat virtual environment.
- Establish protocols to test shadow-casting and fabric-like surface translucency.

#### Activities
1. **Environment Layout**:
   - Define the scale and boundaries of the flat environment.
   - Plan the placement of light sources, projection screens, and test objects.

2. **Testing Protocols**:
   - Adapt SeaScape 360 protocols for virtual testing:
     - Test different lighting angles and intensities.
     - Evaluate shadow projection on front and rear surfaces.
     - Simulate varying material properties (e.g., translucency, texture).

3. **Simulation Requirements**:
   - Outline parameters for light, shadow, and material interactions.
   - Define metrics for evaluating responsiveness and accuracy of shadows.

#### Deliverables
- Design document detailing environment layout and testing protocols.
- List of materials and settings for translucency and shadow quality testing.

### Phase 3: Environment Creation and Initial Testing (35-40 Hours)

#### Objectives
- Build the virtual environment based on the design plan.
- Test the responsiveness of light-shadow interactions and translucent surfaces.

#### Activities
1. **Environment Construction**:
   - Create a flat surface with basic physics properties and defined boundaries.
   - Develop projection screens with adjustable translucency.

2. **Light-Shadow Testing**:
   - Add light sources and test their interactions with simple objects.
   - Observe and document the quality and behavior of shadows on both sides of the projection screen.

3. **Material Experiments**:
   - Apply different material properties to the projection screen and evaluate translucency.
   - Test alpha masking for textures and simulate fabric-like behaviors.

#### Deliverables
- Functional prototype of the flat virtual environment.
- Documentation of initial testing results and material experiments.
